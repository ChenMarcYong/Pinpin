# Pinpin

Pinpin is a 2D action/plateformer made with Unity.

Take control of Pinpin, the last hope of the ice floe, on a mission to save his frozen homeland. Armed with a variety of unique skills, you’ll face off against menacing devil snowmen and strive to rid the ice floe of their sinister presence !

It is a project from our lecture développement extension logiciel where we had to create a game using the unity engine from scratch.
